# Orval Name Override Example

An Example Project to showcase how to avoid name conflicts with Orval.
This Project generates 2 different open-api specs, which both have a model with the same name.

The goal is to generate 2 different models in the generated code as well as not clashing react-query hook names and especially not clashing barrel file exports.

## Run Orval

```shell
npm run generate-api
```
